Dear sir or madam,
you can just run the code by entering the main.py file, there's no other source code file except the main.py
The files: train.csv and test.py is included in the zip file, they are necessary in training and test,please don't delete them 
or move them out of the initial position  

If you want to use other file to test our tree, you need to modify the input of function: datasplit at line 263, 
by changing "fhand" to the file you choose and changing the "amount" to the amount of the total lines in your file  

Finally , the accuracy and the tree object will be printed.(the accuracy tested by "test.csv" is 94.375%)
